    "# Lesson 3: The LLM as a Translation Engine NOT COMPLETED YET\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the grand finale! Let's recap what we've built so far:\n",
    "* **Lesson 1 (RAG):** We taught our LLM how to understand fuzzy human words (\"defrosted dunes\") using NASA's landform dictionary.\n",
    "* **Lesson 2 (APIs):** We wrote a Python script to send a strict Lucene query to NASA's server and get back a clickable link to view an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, *we* are still the ones doing the heavy lifting. We have to manually figure out the exact Lucene syntax and type it into our Python script. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to use the LLM to bridge that gap. We will turn the LLM into a **Translation Engine**. Its only job will be to listen to a user's natural language request and translate it into a perfectly formatted Lucene query that our API script can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guardrails: The Strict System Prompt\n",
    "By default, LLMs love to chat. If we ask it for a query, it might say: *\"Sure! Here is your query: `...` Let me know if you need anything else!\"* Our Python script can't understand that extra text. We need to use a **System Prompt** to strictly forbid the LLM from being conversational."

But the core logic—translating intent into API-readable syntax—is exactly what you just mastered here!"
