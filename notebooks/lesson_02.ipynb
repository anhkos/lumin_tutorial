    "# Lesson 2: Talking to the PDS API\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! In our last notebook, we explored how an LLM can use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to figure out exactly *what* we want to search for in the NASA PDS. We successfully mapped fuzzy human concepts (like \"defrosted dunes\") to rigid database filters (like `dark dune`).\n",
    "\n",
    "But our LLM is currently just talking to us. It isn't actually getting any images!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on the LLM's second job, which is actually **retrieving** the images. We are going to teach the LLM how to use an API to fetch the images we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Wait, what is an API?\n",
    "If you've never used an **API** (Application Programming Interface) before, think of it like a waiter at a restaurant. \n",
    "1. You (the client) sit at the table and look at the menu. \n",
    "2. You can't just walk into the kitchen and start cooking. Instead, you give your order to the waiter (the API).\n",
    "3. The waiter takes your specific order to the kitchen (the server/database), the kitchen prepares it, and the waiter brings your food back to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of food, our API deals with data. We will send a request to the NASA PDS server, and it will hand us back the image data we asked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speaking the Server's Language: Lucene\n",
    "When you type a search into the Atlas IV website, the site uses a query language called **Lucene** to filter millions of images. Lucene is just a specific, structured way to format a search. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) where the sun is high in the sky (Solar Latitude between 0 and 80 degrees), the Lucene query looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`gather.common.mission:\"mro\" AND pds3_label.SOLAR_LATITUDE:[0 TO 80]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a quick Python script to send this exact Lucene query to the PDS Search API!"
